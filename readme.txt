The weather forecast plugin based on OpenWeatherMap API that includes various sidebar widgets and shortcodes

== Description ==

WCP OpenWeather plugin allows you to add various widgets and shortcodes with current weather or forecast for your city. 
Our plugin is based on free [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/) and uses free API key for weather data receiving with limitation for this plan, but you can buy any key for [paid plans](http://openweathermap.org/price/) and use it for your purposes.
In additional, plugin supports different themes, but currently is available only one default theme. We are working on creation of new themes for widgets/shortcodes, so it will be added soon. With default theme you are able to customize background/text colors for widgets/shortcodes.

Live demo you can find [here](http://wpdemo.webcodin.com/weather-forecast/).

= Multilanguage Functionality =

Currently, we are working on the plugin multilanguage functionality. In this plugin realize we added support for following list of the languages:

* English (default);
* Russian;
* Ukrainian.

Multilanguage functionality has limitation based on [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/forecast16#multi) languages support, i.e. city name has no translation for city name by default and description of weather conditions have translation only for languages form [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/forecast16#multi) API list.

Currently, translation of the city names realized via Google autocomplete for city name based on active language for the plugin. 

If you want to help with plugin translation on your language please let us know via demo site [contact form](http://wpdemo.webcodin.com/stay-in-touch/) or directly via support@webcodin.com. We will send you .xlsx or .po file with necessary variables for translations.

**NB!** Translation of the city name to the active language occurs when you choose city from the Google Autocomplete list. When You change the current language then city name in the existing shortcodes and widgets will not be automatically translated to the new language. To do this, select the city again, and save the changes.
